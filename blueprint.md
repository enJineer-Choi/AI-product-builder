# Menu Recommender

## Overview

A web application that helps users decide what to eat for lunch or dinner. Users can select the meal type, and the app randomly recommends a delicious option.

## Features

*   **Meal Type Selection:** Users can choose between "Lunch" and "Dinner".
*   **Random Recommendation:** Randomly selects a menu item from a curated list based on the selected meal type.
*   **Visual Feedback:** Displays the recommended menu with a clear, appetizing presentation.
*   **Dark/Light Mode:** Supports both dark and light themes for comfortable viewing at any time of day.

## Technical Details

*   **HTML:** Semantic structure with radio buttons for selection and a display area for results.
*   **CSS:** Responsive design with modern styling. Retains the previous dark/light mode capability.
*   **JavaScript:** Logic to handle user selection and random array sampling.

## Current Plan (Transformation from Lotto App)

1.  **Refactor HTML:** Change titles, remove lotto specific elements, add meal type selectors (Lunch/Dinner).
2.  **Update CSS:** Adjust styles for the new layout (menu card vs number circles).
3.  **Rewrite JavaScript:**
    *   Define arrays for Lunch and Dinner menus.
    *   Implement logic to pick a random item based on selection.
    *   Update the UI with the result.
4.  **Deployment:** Commit and push to GitHub.
